2020: TVDB changed their API terms of service, and I have not checked whether this tool still works.

A simple tool for renaming video files downloaded from
[Rifftrax](http://www.rifftrax.com)
to a form that
[Plex](https://plex.tv/)
prefers.

Example: `LitterMonster_med.mp4` to `Rifftrax - s03e264 - The Litter Monster.mp4`
